Upload whatever files you are working on, and give suggestions/make edits to files on this repository.

The Remote Desktop File can be used to remotely access my PC in order to do high performance simulations and similar tasks. The simulation account is normally disabled (so you cannot just kick me off my own computer...), so just let me know when you need to use it and I can try to work some time out.

Also, Steam is disabled for the account, so you'll have to put up with me in person if you want to play my games...

I'll send the login credentials in our group chat, but if you can't find it just send me a text.
